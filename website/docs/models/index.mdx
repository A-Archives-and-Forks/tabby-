## Alternative Registry

By default, Tabby utilizes the [Hugging Face organization](https://huggingface.co/TabbyML) as its model registry. Mainland Chinese users have encountered challenges accessing Hugging Face for various reasons. The Tabby team has established a mirrored at [modelscope](https://www.modelscope.cn/organization/TabbyML), which can be utilized using the following environment variable:

```bash
TABBY_REGISTRY=modelscope tabby serve --model TabbyML/StarCoder-1B
```
